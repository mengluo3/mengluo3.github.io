		<p>This tagline popped into mind while I was sketching around during a visit to China. It was meant to describe 
		my journals, whose contents are probably the closest approximation to the actual thoughts that play in my mind. 
		After a while, however, I started adding the phrase to all my media platforms, for everything I put out is an 
		echo of the noise inside my brain. This site was born when I couldn't decide whether to post the 
		'<a href="light-and-water.html" target="_blank">Light and Water</a>' video clips to Medium or Twitter. 
		I realized my thoughts were strewn in random shreds across the internet, without a central core, so, instead 
		of choosing, I decided to just develop one giant collection of all my creations, adding a more 
		personal touch with animations and formatting.</p>
		<p>The fish in the animation swims toward the depths of the page, diving into the entryway of the 'inner landscape'.
		That is the purpose of this site. It will stretch and expand as I create and consume, perhaps losing a sense of coherent 
		theme, filling up instead with pockets of tangents and clashing designs. What forms will it take on as it grows? 
		Right now the question is unclear, but I hope you enjoy it long enough to witness the answer :))</p>

		<p>With that being said, welcome to this space I've carved out in the web!
