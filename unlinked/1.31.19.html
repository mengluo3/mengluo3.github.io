	<i><p>Thoughts I wanted to share after writing to Y</p></i>
	<p>I'm writing from the end of January. To be honest, this month has dried me out a little. I have not been playing so much with ideas, with stories, but rather, returning to the ground to consider practical things of the future. It was a bit stressful at first (what do I want to do in 10 years? How do I plan? Looking far into an uncertain future can either be exciting or looming...), but this is a normal pressure of pre-college, I think. I trust things will work out...</p>

	<p><i>Design/Peter Pan Syndrome</i></p>
	<p>One option I have been considering, besides research/academia, is design. I've begun some online courses from UCSD. <a href="https://mengluo3.github.io/design-content/current/week1.html">Week 1 Assignment</a>. Tech and invention centered around people's psychology and limits: I find the idea interesting, though I do not know much about the technicalities yet. The charm is similar to what drew me to neuroscience. One bit that bothers me about digital UX design, however, is how clean and sleek and BRIGHT all the websites are...it reminds me of modern architecture: all straight lines, white, and sleek (I like muted colors, all together to form something vibrant). I prefer something more organic, natural(?), a sense of spirit that creates a experience you treasure, perhaps that moves you. Like an old record store, or a forest where sunlight streams through the tree canopies. But that would be categorized under "art", not "design." Perhaps there will be a postmodern movement haha, like in architecture. </p>

	<p> Art is boundless, unlimited, and free. Whereas design, in many cases, is all about limits: working with limited resources and time to create solutions that help people do more within their limits.</p>
		<p>(example: curb cuts, the slopes where the sidewalk meets the street at corners. These are a design feature that help the wheelchair-bound roll from street to street without aid. As a result, anyone rolling heavy luggage benefits as well...when we design for people with the deepest limits, we design for wider society). </p>

	<p>So, among the other jumble of potential futures in the soup of my mind, design has been added. </p>

	<p>The adult world of networking, business, professionalism that I see in online "day-in-my-life" videos and articles ("hustling", "grinding", etc)...it all makes me treasure so, so much more my current time I have to think and wander through stories, science, and the world. Feeling deeply human, feeling moved...like the contents of Brain Picking...perhaps that is harder to reach with a professional, busy lifestyle. Perhaps childhood is art, adulting is design. </p>

	<p>Peter Pan Syndrome, a desire to stay free forever.</p>

	<p>Tweeting tires me out. I compulsively want to share my thoughts, but recently I feel I have been using so many emojis and exclamation marks...somehow my online self is too high-energy for me haha.</p>

	<p> (I don't know why I want to share, either. What makes me think my thoughts are worth sharing? I don't know if I tweet just because it is convenient for me for personal documentation...but sometimes the tweets feel too personal for comfort after I reread. Before, I was inspired by blogs...currently questioning my online behaviors.)</p>
