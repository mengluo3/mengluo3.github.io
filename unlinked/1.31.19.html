	<p>I'm writing from the end of January. To be honest, this month has dried me out a little. I have not been playing so much with ideas, with stories, but rather, returning to the ground to consider practical things of the future. It was a bit stressful at first (what do I want to do in 10 years? How do I plan? Looking far into an uncertain future can either be exciting or looming...), but this is a normal pressure of growing up, I think. I trust things will work out...</p>

	<p><i>Design/Peter Pan Syndrome</i></p>
	<p>One option I have been considering, besides research/academia, is design. I began a Coursera course on design fundamentals! <a href="https://mengluo3.github.io/design-content/current/week1.html">Here</a> is my assignment for Week 1. I find the idea interesting, tech and invention centered around people's psychology and limits, though I do not know much about the technicalities yet. The charm is similar to what drew me to neuroscience. One bit that bothers me about digital UX design, however, is how clean and sleek and BRIGHT all the websites are...it reminds me of modern architecture, all straight lines, white, and sleek (I like muted colors, all together to form something vibrant). I prefer something more organic, natural(?), a sense of spirit that creates a experience you treasure, perhaps that moves you. Like an old record store, or a forest where sunlight streams through the tree canopies. But that would be categorized under "art", not "design." Perhaps there will be a postmodern movement haha, like in architecture. </p>

	<p>Design is all about limits. Art is boundless, unlimited, and free. Whereas design is about working within limited resources and time to create solutions that help people do more within their limits (example: curb cuts, the slopes where the sidewalk meets the street at corners. These are a design feature that help the wheelchair-bound roll from street to street without aid. As a result, anyone rolling heavy luggage benefits as well...when we design for people with the deepest limits, we design for wider society). </p>

	<p>So, among the other jumble of potential futures in the soup of my mind, design has been added. </p>

	<p>The adult world of networking, business, professionalism that I see in online "day-in-my-life" videos and articles ("hustling", "grinding", etc)...it all makes me treasure my current time I have to think and wander through stories, science, and the world, so, so much more. A deeper vein of life...feeling deeply human, feeling moved...like the contents of Brain Picking...perhaps that is harder to reach with a professional, busy lifestyle. Perhaps childhood is art, adulting is design. </p>
