	<p>Intense, right?</p>

	<p>I stumbled upon this photo at Freer Sackler Gallery of Asian Art, one of my favorite places in DC. 

	<p>Writing. It's difficult.</p>
	<p>I'm currently trying to stammer out a quality essay for <a href="https://twitter.com/antholegacies?lang=en" target="blank">Legacies: An Asian American Anthology</a>, for which I was accepted as both an illustrator and a writer. I'm grateful. I want to do a good job. The problem is: THE WORDS ARE STUCK. </p>



	<p>
	Write. Stop. Think. Stop.<br><br>
	Write. Stop. Think. Stop.<br><br>
	Write. Stop. Think. Stop.<br><br>
	On and on and on...
	</p>
	<p>I've been writing (...and stopping...and thinking) for a whole week now. The first draft is due in three days, on Monday (2/11/19). </p>
	<p>How do I write in a way that is appealing, yet clear? I look at some of my past writing, and it doesn't seem that bad. Why am I so paralyzed now? </p>
	<p>Especially the introduction. God, how do I start an introduction? </p>
	<p>I don't want to be overly sentimental. I don't want to overexaggerate my feelings. Emotional intensity in writing is like photo-saturation: too heavy-handed, and the moment can become overdramatic. Yet, without feeling, the piece becomes entirely colorless, which is not accurate either.</p>
	<p>The whole essay becomes an enormous balancing act, a challenge worthy of a tightrope walker.</p>
	<p>And then there's the whole process of selecting details to include. So many factors! So much noise! We like to link events together as cause and effect, to simplify and delineate, but in reality, there might be a thousand subliminal factors that contribute to one decision. It is a difficult feat, picking out a clean narrative from this tangled, chaotic mess that is the real world. </p>
	<p>Props to all you writers out there. You have my respect.</p>

	<p>Update: 02/09/19, Saturday</p>
	<p>Writing, it went well today :) Perhaps because today is Saturday; perhaps because I had more time to work; perhaps because I went to a different library. Maybe I just had to ram my head against a wall for a whole week before something stuck. Whatever the case, it worked. The words are unclogged. </p>


	There are two buildings I'd consider a second home: Davis Library and Freer Sackler Gallery of Art. 
	If you're ever in the DC area, I highly recommend paying a visit to the Freer Sackler Gallery of Asian Art. 

	Freer Sackler Gallery of Asian Art is a place where historical and contemporary mix, 
	Perhaps my favorite place in DC is Freer SAckler Gallery of Art. 
	Freer Sackler Gallery of Art is a place I'll sorely miss when I leave the DMV.

	When I leave DMV, Freer Sackler Gallery of Art is a place I'll sorely miss. 

	One of my favorite pastimes is to simply just...loiter. To walk around somewhere 

	<p>One of my favorite places in DC is Freer Sackler Gallery of Asian Art. I always leave the building feeling refreshed and rejuvenated, inspired even, after having absorbed new sights. 
	If that's what academia looks like, I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind at all. 

	

	I couldn't access much because I wasn't a researcher. Reading on Asian art and writing up papers, if that's what life in academia looks like, I wouldn't mind. I wouldn't mind at all. 

	Time spent at Freer Sackler is not time wasted :))
	Time spent at Freer Sackler is time well-spent. 
	Time spent at Freer Sackler is never time wasted :)
	Freer Sackler is potentially my favorite place in Washington DC.

	Life is too good. I can't shake the feeling that I am being overly indulgent. 

	I did learn some damn good pinyin. Thanks, nan qing cheng.
