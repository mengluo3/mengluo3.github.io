	<p>Writing. It's difficult.</p>
	<p>I'm currently trying to stammer out a quality essay for Legacies: An Asian American Anthology, for which I was accepted as both an illustrator and a writer. I'm grateful, and I want to do a good job, but the problem is: THE WORDS ARE STUCK. </p>
	<p>
	Write. Stop. Think. Stop.<br><br>
	Write. Stop. Think. Stop.<br><br>
	Write. Stop. Think. Stop.<br><br>
	On and on and on...
	</p>
	<p>I've been writing (...and stopping...and thinking) for a whole week now. The first draft is due in three days, on Monday (2/11/19). </p>
	<p>How do I write in a way that is appealing, yet clear? I look at some of my past writing, and it doesn't seem that bad. Why am I so paralyzed now? </p>
	<p>Especially the introduction. God, how do I start an introduction? </p>
	<p>I don't want to be overly sentimental. I don't want to overexaggerate my feelings. Emotional intensity in writing is like photo-saturation: too heavy-handed, and the moment becomes unrealistic. Yet, without feeling, the piece becomes entirely colorless, which is not accurate either.</p>
	<p>The whole essay becomes an enormous balancing act, a challenge worthy of a tightrope walker.</p>
	<p>And then there's the whole process of selecting details to include. So much noise! So many factors! We like to link events together as cause and effect, to simplify and delineate, but in reality, there might be a thousand subliminal factors that contribute to one decision. It is a difficult feat, picking out a clean narrative from this tangled, chaotic mess that is the real world. </p>
	<p>Props to all you writers out there. You have my respect.</p>

	<p>Update: 02.09.19, Saturday</p>
	<p>Writing, it went well today :) Perhaps because today is Saturday; perhaps because I had more time to work; perhaps because I went to a different library. Maybe I just had to ram my head a whole week before something stuck. Whatever the case, it worked. The words are unclogged. </p>
