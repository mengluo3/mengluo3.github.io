		<p>Some thoughts + updates from today that I wanted to post on Twitter, but, too much of a hassle:</p>

		<br>

		<p>1. I've got a part-time job! The fact that I am paid now means that I can support my favorite creators on Patreon :)</p>
		<p>(Haven't gotten to this yet. I will fix that soon.)</p>

		<br>

		<p>2. I've been gone for the last two months to volunteer at a special needs center in China. I'm hoping (hoping) to write a few essays on the design of the program (not purely voluntourism?), special needs in China, and my own personal experience as a volunteer.  </p>

		<br>

		<p>3. This afternoon:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>	6PM -- Got off work, ate dinner, biked to the library</li>
			<li>	Worked on a website for the special needs center, which I may or may not release depending on the quality. Regardless, it is good HTML/CSS practice, especially since I've begun documenting my struggles and solutions. </li>

			<ul>
				<li>			Code documentation + process documentation not only make my code clearer, but they also help me learn by forcing me to explain myself.</li>
				<li>I didn't find many SOLUTIONS today, but I created new, specific QUESTIONS to find answers to. That is progress :)))</li>
			</ul>
		

			<li>	Biked home while singing and thinking about how to tweet the afternoon (haha, guilty as charged). The sky was cloudy, but there were some slivers of pink from the sunset.</li>
			<li> Got home, started working on an art project that I hope I can share soon :)</li>
		</ul>
		<br>

		<p>4. Working a part-time job where I am standing + constantly in motion seems to enhance my productivity. It distracts from my fatigue + creates a momentum where I want to continue working on other projects. </p>

		<br>

		<p>Wanted to tweet because I was unsually productive today. Plus, it was just a good day. I'm pretty happy.</p>

		A gift from one of the special needs kids, from my last day in China. He folded me a plane because I was flying back to America. (Hahahaha, get it?)
