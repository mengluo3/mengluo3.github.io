		<p>Dear 2021 Yufei,</p>
		<p>HELLO! It's been a while since I have composed something more artful(?) to you. I miss that kind of imaginative and exploratory dynamic, 
		so I wanted to take a stab at returning to that form. </p>

		<p><i>Recently someone asked me: "How was your 2020?" Forwarding part of my answer here:</i></p>

		<p> On a personal level, my 2020 was not too bad. The people around me are mostly safe, and any struggles I did have, were mostly due to my own overthinking nature rather than any external circumstances. I went through what felt like continual cycles of defeat and rebirth (sounds dramatic LOL but this is honestly how I felt about it — one day lamenting lack of energy, the next day feeling like, "nahh we gotta go forward even if my pace is slow as heck right now." In my own head I felt real phoenix-like HAHA), but these slumps are as per usual. I think my baseline energy may have risen (at least in the past two weeks), because I just found out that previously I was severely lacking in protein, and since introducing more protein sources into my diet, I have regained some mental lucidity.</p>
		<p>But! Overall I have gotten better about drumming up more regular consistency in my life, so I feel consoled by the fact that although the graph of my trajectory may have many several dips, the general trend seems to be going upwards. Software tools (e.g.: Futureland.tv, Remnotes, and a spreadsheet journal) have helped, and feel more natural to me than tools like Google Calendar, since they go hand-in-hand with my compulsion to document my entire life.</p>

		<p>The other upside of the last year and a half is that I feel that I have met a greater variety of folks than usual (?) Remotely during pandemic times of course, through phone calls. During quarantine I discovered an app called DialUp that matches you with a random stranger around the world for a phone call, and it reminded me of your story about the paper planes! The app has a cozy and home-cooked flavor. I'm curious if the async format of pandemic has let you focus more on single-player activities or if the isolation has driven you to reach out to more people (I remember you writing that the start of pandemic was especially busy on your end).</p>

		<p>On the creative side, my output has slowed to a trickle. I am still doing a little bit of creative coding, as I'm helping one of my university clubs with designing a conference site, but otherwise much of my energy has been geared towards professional development. I HAD bought a mini keyboard (PSS-A50) about 40 days ago (lured by the siren call of many videos of producers and songwriters talking about the atmospheres, textures, and emotions they want to capture with their sound and the lyrics). I have managed to practice some everyday, but I don't really have the skill or knowledge to create anything of my own with it.</p>

		<p>The reason I tell people I chose the PSS-A50 over other keyboards is because the inner wannabe-minimalist in me appreciates the portable mini size (which I do — that inner wannabe-minimalist, she has a very LARGE-scale love for things small-scale lol), but another small voice in me whispers, "It's affordable enough compared to other options that if my interest is fleeting, I won't feel *too* guilty about shelving it away and playing it sporadically." Anyway I really want this interest to be sustained, but I have no idea because the axis of my interests keeps spinning all over the place. A strong tendency towards chronic dabbling is the undercurrent that runs underneath all my curiosities for now.</p>

		<p>Yeah, anyway, as per usual, I have written a lot more than I initially expected! Absolutely all good if you haven't the time to respond extensively. How about yourself? Have there been any themes in your 2020? Any new goals you want to plant in 2021, creative or otherwise? </p>
