	<p>I like that music seems to deepen the world's colors and moods.</p>

	<p>I have a tendency to overplay songs I like. After a certain point I have to take a break because the 
	notes crumble into plain noise. As a result, my playlists are not named by genre of artist, but rather by date. 
	Scroll through my Spotify profile and you'll find a timescape, each playlist a distinct period of time, with a 
	different texture, in the context of a different set of memories.</p>

	<p>(Also, yes, that is a photo of me.)</p>
