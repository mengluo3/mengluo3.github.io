        <p> I tried dragonflies, I tried butterflies, but I like fish the most after all :)</p>
        <p>Drawing this, many times I thought, "Ah, this is good. Letâ€™s leave it as is," but then decided to add more detail. I want to practice pushing myself so my drawings reach a more finished state.</p>
        <p>I imagine this guy as a writer, drinking some convenience store coffee after an all-nighter, feeling satisfied because he met his deadline. He watches the life outside the convenience store window and new thoughts bubble up.</p>
        <p>"Ah, life is good."</p>
        <p>That's the kind of feeling.</p>
