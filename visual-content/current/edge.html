    	<p>Have you ever seen a broad sunset and felt the world so free and wide?</p>

    	<p>I wanted to capture that wide space with an expansive field and sky. This drawing really was an exercise in pushing my paintings past a sketching point. Previously I would be satisfied with this version:</p>
    	<img src="../../images/visual_content/pre_edge.PNG" alt="blog" width="300" padding-left="150" padding-right="150">
    	<p>but this time, at each point which I thought I could be done, I asked, "What more could I add to this image?"</p>

    	<p><i>Side note</i>: while I was drawing, I heard shots outside. It freaked me out, because I thought for a second they were gunshots. It turned out they were fireworks...because the clock had struck 12! The new year had rung in!</p>

    	<p>It's not a bad way to start the new year, drawing :)</p>
