            <p>I drew this image after reading “Absolutely on Music: Conversations”, a documentation of Haruki Murakami’s extended interview with Seiji Ozawa, the former conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. I admire Murakami’s rhythm and prose, and I really love memoirs*, so I enjoyed the book :) </p>

            <p>The way Murakami and Ozawa talk, you can tell music stirs something within them. I wanted to capture that feeling in this illustration. The boy in the image wears an expression that shows what I feel is an <i>understanding</i> of the music. I like the contrast between the boy’s simple appearance and the cello’s elegance. I like the way even his toes dance. Anyone can enjoy music! </p>

            <p> Here is <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah0oV1GM35Q&index=10&list=OLAK5uy_nZ9ZKXlzrkJEl6xc0CPUr049S2w_PWoOY”>some</a> <a href=”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mJ_fkw5j-t0”>accompaniment</a>.</p>

            <p>On the first song: admittedly, I don’t listen to a lot of classical music. However, this description repeatedly popped up in ‘Absolutely on Music: Conversations’:</p>

            <p>"the piano and orchestra intertwine."</p>

            <p>I like that image because it sounds like the instrument’s sounds are strands of light weaving around each other. Reading that, and listening to the guitar and cello together, it’s fun to imagine the two sounds as two strands of dancing light.</p>
