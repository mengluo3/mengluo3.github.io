		<p>This editorial illustration is based on Sixth Tone’s article <a href="https://medium.com/sixth-tone/chinas-young-children-are-overheating-in-the-middle-of-winter-1849b392dbf5">China’s Young Children Are Overheating in the Middle of Winter"</a> by Dai Wangyun. It’s about how concerned parents tend to overbundle their kids in winter clothes. When I read the article, the first image that came to mind was a Russian doll, with each layer of the doll as another jacket. I got pretty attached to the idea, but after some more thinking, I decided a melting snowman would get the point across better, even if it’s not as visually interesting. </p>

		<p>From there I began to fine-tune the draft. I really tried to apply a design mindset to this project, taking into consideration how perspective, colors, detail, etcetera would all contribute to the message of the drawing.</p>

		<p>For example:</p>
		<li>Chose an upward perspective so the viewer could see the melt/sweat beads dripping down from the snowman.</li>
		<li>How do we know the snowman and the woman are mother and child? They are holding hands + the snowman is wearing a backpack, a yellow hat, and generally bright, round clothes (showing it is a child).</li>
		<li>Obscured the mother's face so that the focus would be on the snowman's overheating, and not the mother. </li>
		<li>Bare tree + blue colors in the background to indicate the season is winter. </li>
