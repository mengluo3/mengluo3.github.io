		<header>What purpose does this object serve?</header>
		<p>This is the door to the library's quiet room. Its primary purpose is to provide an entryway into the room while insulating noise from the rest of the library, giving people a place to work, study, and read -- a space for concentration to flow, away from the voices (oftentimes of crying children) that brew outside. </p>

		<p>Properties:</p>
		<li>Heavier than most doors (to insulate noise)</li>
		<li> Metal hinges on one side, lock and lever doorknob on the other side </li>
		<li>Wooden frame and glass center</li>

		<p>The glass center is a major design strength, allowing people to check seat availability from outside without disturbing the deep concentration of those within.</p>

		<br>

		<header>What usability issues are there?</header>
		
		<p>The door is great at noise insulation, but for a quiet room, the act of shutting the door is awfully loud. The frequency of people entering and leaving creates enough noise to disturb those inside.</p>
		<p> There are four main ways people interact with the doorknob:</p>

		<div class="table_container">

			<div class="container_vertical">

				<p style="font-weight:bold"> (1) Loud, Minimal Thought, Closed</p>
				<video controls="controls" height="200" 
		       		name="Clack" src="../../images/design_content/week1/IMG_2602.mp4">
				</video>
				<p>Shutting the door normally <br>creates a lot of sound.</p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<div class="container_vertical">
				<p style="font-weight:bold"> (2) Quiet, More Thought, Closed</p>
				<video controls="controls" height="200" 
		       		name="Rest" src="../../images/design_content/week1/IMG_2599.mp4">
				</video>
				<p>Shutting the door slowly and <br> deliberately minimizes sound, but it creates <br>a friction point for the door-shutter.</p>
			</div>
			
		</div>

		<br>

		<div class="table_container">

			<div class="container_vertical">
				<p style="font-weight:bold">(3) Medium, Minimal Thought, Open</p>
				<video controls="controls" height="200" 
		       		name="Open" src="../../images/design_content/week1/IMG_2600.mp4">
				</video>
				<p>Some just leave the door open, especially<br> when they plan to exit the room soon. <br>Noise from outside leaks in.</p>
			</div>
			<br>

			<div class="container_vertical">
				<p style="font-weight:bold">(4) Quiet, More Thought, Open</p>
				<video controls="controls" height="200" 
		       		name="Quiet and Careful" src="../../images/design_content/week1/IMG_2601.mp4">
				</video>
				<p>Here the door-shutter leaves the <br>door resting on its latch, minimizing <br>sound, but creating a friction point in <br>their experience.</p>

		<header>Example participation observations: How did people interact with the object?</header>
		<br>

			<p style="font-size:12px;"> 
				<i>1:31 PM -- Person A</i><br>
				Profile: Middle-aged man, in winter clothes and backpack, exiting room<br><br>
				Door state (before): Not completely shut, resting on latch (option 4)<br><br>
				Interaction: Opened the door by pulling the handle, then closed the door slowly behind him, resting the door on the latch (option 4).
			</p>


		<br>
			<p style="font-size:12px;"> 
				<i>1:33 PM -- Person B</i><br>
				Profile: Middle-aged woman, a librarian, entering the room to reshelve magazines.<br><br>
				Door state (before): Not completely shut, resting on latch (option 4)<br><br>
				Interaction: Moved the lever handle down to enter the room (creating noise), then left the door slightly ajar (similar to option 4). Exited the room at 1:35 PM, closing the door behind her slowly and completely (option 2).
			</p>
	
		<br>
			<p style="font-size:12px;"> 
				<i>1:40 PM -- Person C</i><br> 
				Profile: Small, elderly woman, entering the room to browse magazines<br><br>
				Door state (before): Shut completely.<br><br>
				Interaction: Pulled the lever handle towards her to enter the room, I made eye-contact with her and smiled, she closed the door very slowly and completely, with extreme caution and care (option 2). Exited the room at 1:43, once again very careful to shut the door slowly and completely (option 2). 
			</p>
		<br>
			<p style="font-size:12px;"> 
				<i>1:50 PM -- Person D</i></i><br>
				Profile: Me, young woman, exiting the room to get scratch paper.<br><br>
				Door state (before): Shut completely.<br><br>
				Interaction: Moved the lever handle down to exit the room, left the door slightly open (similar to option 4) because I knew I would enter again soon. When I returned, the door was closed, so I moved the lever handle down, pushed the door, and after entering, closed the door completely, but slowly (option 2). 
			</p>

		<br><br>
		
		<header>Did previous users leave usability cues?</header>
		<p>There was nothing explicitly written (post-it notes, signs, etc), but some users left the door resting on its latch (option 4 above), which led subsequent users to follow this precedent (e.g. Person A).</p>

		<br>
		<header>Bonus: How can we solve the usability issue?</header>
		<br>
		<div class="container">
			<video controls="controls" height="400" 
	       		name="Searching Left and Right" src="../../images/design_content/week1/IMG_2604.mov">
			</video>
			<p style="color:white">'                    '</p>

			<div class="container_vertical">
				<center><img src="../../images/design_content/week1/closer.jpg" width="200"></center>
				<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:70px;">For comparison, I tested the library's bathroom door, which is significantly quieter for two reasons: (1) There is no latch, and (2) there is a closer arm (example pictured above) installed at the top of the door, which slows down the speed at which the door closes.
				</p>

				<p style="text-align:left; padding-left:70px;">The door to the quiet room would benefit from removing latches and replacing the current lock with a dead lock, which stays within the door when unlocked. The closer arm could reduce a little noise as well, but the cost is much higher. 
				</p>

		<header>Personal Notes for Improvement</header>
		<p>Next time I'd like to take better photographs, taking note of details like the lock, the closing arm, etc, focusing in on them with straight-on camera shots. </p>
